# Experimentally-Assessing-the-Controllers-for-Neural-Architecture-Search-
Neural networks are powerful and flexible models that work well for many com- plicated tasks such as computer vision, text & speech processing, combinatorial optimization problems, etc. “AI that creates AI”, was a common headline of what people initially described as Automated Machine Learning (i.e. Auto ML). This novel concept gained attraction in 2016 when Google Brain released their first “Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning (NAS)”. Traditionally, choosing a neural network architecture manually is a tiring, inefficient & computationally expensive task. Even the standard NAS is very computationally expensive as it required over 450 GPU’s for 3-4 days to train on CIFAR-10. We are analyzing & reproducing the method of standard Neural Architecture Search (NAS) through an existing improved method known as “Efficient Neural Architecture Search via Parameter Sharing (ENAS)”. We are assessing the quality of the ENAS architectures’ RNN controller using different experimental techniques such as search space poisoning and random search to see how the controller performs when decoupled with strong search spaces.
